Code to generate figures and tables in paper. 

- `sim_pp5.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-5BC on simulated families with family structures sampled from the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 2, Supplemental Figure S6 (left), and Supplemental Tables S2 and S8.  
- `sim_pp7.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-7 on simulated families (under full and sub-model assumptions) with family structures sampled from the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Supplemental Figure S1 and Supplemental Table S1. 
- `sim_pp11.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on simulated families with family structures sampled from the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 3, Supplemental Figure S6 (right), and Supplemental Table S3 and S9.  
- `sim_pp11_AUC.R`: Examine relationships between relative risks/allele frequencies and the AUCs from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on simulated families with family structures sampled from the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 4, Supplemental Figures S2-S3, and Supplemental Table S4. 
- `sim_pp11_prs.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on simulated families with an additional unmeasured PRS. Corresponds to Supplemental Figure S4 and Supplemental Table S5. 
- `sim_pp11_bootstrap.R`: Visualize the distributions of diagnostic metrics across bootstrap samples. Corresponds to Supplemental Figures S8-S9. 
- `upper_pp5.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-5BC on simulated families with a large number of relatives. Corresponds to Supplemental Figure S10 and Supplemental Table S12. 
- `upper_pp11.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on simulated families with a large number of relatives. Corresponds to Supplemental Figure S11 and Supplemental Table S13. 
- `usc_pp5.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-5BC on the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figure 5, Supplemental Figure S7 (left), and Supplemental Tables S6 and S10. 
- `usc_pp11.R`: Visualize and summarize diagnostic metrics from evaluating PanelPRO-11 on the HCP cohort. Corresponds to Figures 6-7, Supplemental Figures S5 and S7 (right), and Supplemental Tables S7 and S11.
