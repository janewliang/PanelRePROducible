#' Generate Unique IDs and Sex in a Branch and Link Parents' IDs
#' 
#' Returns a data frame with 4 columns: \code{ID}, \code{Sex}, \code{MotherID}, 
#' and \code{FatherID}. There will be a row for each of the progeny, plus a row for  
#' any parent that were simulated/not blood a relation of the main family, i.e. 
#' spouses or the grandparents. \code{ID} stores the individuals' ID, \code{Sex} 
#' stores their sex, and \code{MotherID} and \code{FatherID} stores their 
#' parent's IDs. A parental ID of 0 corresponds to a parent who is not part of the 
#' family matrix. 
#' @param nDaughters number of daughters in branch
#' @param nSons number of sons in branch
#' @param mothID mother's ID, if known (optional)
#' @param fathID father's ID, if known (optional)
#' @param lastID the largest ID number that is already in use. 
#' @param includeParents boolean flag, indicating whether to assign IDs to the 
#' parents. Defaults to TRUE
#' Defaults to 0 (i.e. new IDs will start from 1)
#' @details If the \code{mothID} and/or \code{fathID} is not known, the mother 
#' and/or father is assumed to have been simulated.
