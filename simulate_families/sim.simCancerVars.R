#' Generate the \code{isAff} and \code{Age} Variables for Each Cancer
#'
#' Generates the \code{isAff} indicator and \code{Age} of diagnosis variables for 
#' each cancer, plus \code{isAffAny} (indicator for having any cancer) and 
#' \code{AgeAny} (age of diagnosis for first cancer). Also returns an overall 
#' \code{isDead} indicator variable and an updated \code{CurAge} variable based 
#' on the minimum of the death age and original current age. Incorporates 
#' censoring. Returns matrix with dimensions \code{number of members} by 
#' \code{2 x (number of cancers) + 4}. 
#' @param genoMat genotype matrix for the family (one row for each family member). 
#' @param Gender indicator vector (1 for males, 0 for females) of same length as 
#' number of rows in \code{genoMat}. 
#' @param CurAge vector of current ages for each family member; of same length as 
#' number of rows in \code{genoMat}. 
#' @param CP list of cancer penetrance matrices, one for each gender. 
#' @param PG vector of possible genotypes. 
#' @param cancers vector of cancers to include in the model. 
#' @param ageMax maximum age to consider. Defaults to 94. 
#' @param ageMin minimum age to consider. Defaults to 2. 
#' @param censoring if FALSE, then will assume everyone without any cancers lives
#' to the maximum age. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param affTime if TRUE, the output will include the cancer times (which may 
#' or may not be observed due to censoring). Defaults to FALSE
#' @details Assumes naming conventions for cancers are consistent between arguments. 
#' The first column in the output matrix will be the current age \code{CurAge} and 
#' last column will be the indicator for death \code{isDead}. The 
#' \code{2 x (number of cancers) + 2} columns in the middle are the \code{isAff} 
#' and \code{Age} variables for each cancer, plus the two columns for any cancer.
