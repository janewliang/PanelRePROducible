#' Simulate Current Ages for Branch
#'
#' Returns a numeric vector of current ages for the progeny of the  
#' branch, plus any parents who have missing ages (parents who were simulated/not 
#' blood relations of the main family, i.e. spouses or the grandparents). The 
#' childrens' ages are simulated based on their mother's age. 
#' @param nProg number of progeny in branch
#' @param mothAge mother's age, if known (optional)
#' @param fathAge father's age, if known (optional)
#' @details Does not ensure that the children have different ages from each other
#' (i.e., two siblings with the same ages are not necessarily twins).
#' If one of the parents' ages is missing, it will be simulated based on the other 
#' parent's age. If both are missing, they will be assumed to be at the top of tree 
#' (grandparents). The grandmother's age will be simulated from a Norm(100, 2) 
#' distribution and the grandfather's age will be simulated based on her age.
