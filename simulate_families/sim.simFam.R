#' Underlying Function to Simulate a Family/Pedigree Matrix
#' 
#' Returns a completed family matrix with the following columns for each member: 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{ID} = Member identifier
#'   \item \code{MotherID} = Mother's identifier number
#'   \item \code{FatherID} = Father's identifier number
#'   \item \code{Sex} = 1 for males, 0 for females
#'   \item \code{isProband} = Indicator for whether or not person is proband
#'   \item \code{CurAge} = Family member's current age, or age at death if dead
#'   \item \code{isAffCancer} variables = Indicators for whether or not person 
#'   had cancer type \code{Cancer}, e.g. \code{isAffBC}, \code{isAffO}, etc, plus
#'   an indicator \code{isAffAny} for having any cancer
#'   \item \code{AgeCancer} variables = Age of cancer diagnosis for cancer type 
#'   \code{Cancer}, e.g. \code{isAffBC}, \code{isAffO}, etc, plus the age of 
#'   first cancer diagnosis \code{AgeAny}. 0 if person did not have that cancer 
#'   type
#'   \item \code{isDead} = Indicator for whether or not person is dead
#'   \item \code{Twins} = Twin status, set to 0 for not twins (not simulated)
#'   \item \code{Ancestry} = Ancestry, set to "nonAJ" (not simulated)
#'   \item \code{race} = Race, set to "All_Races" (not simulated)
#'   \item \code{riskmod} = Risk modifier/intervention types, set to empty for 
#'   no risk modifiers (not simulated)
#'   \item \code{interAge} = Age of risk modifiers/interventions, set to 
#'   empty for no risk modifiers (not simulated)
#' }
#' @param nSibsPatern vector of length \code{2}, indicating the number of sisters 
#' and brothers the father has (does not include father) 
#' @param nSibsMatern vector of length \code{2}, indicating the number of sisters 
#' and brothers the mother has (does not include mother) 
#' @param nSibs vector of length \code{2}, indicating the number of sisters and 
#' brothers the proband has (does not include proband) 
#' @param nGrandchild \code{sum(nSibs)+1} by \code{2} matrix, indicating the number 
#' of daughters and number of sons that the proband and each of her siblings have. 
#' Each row corresponds to the children of one of the members of \code{nChild}, with 
#' the proband as the first row. Alternatively, \code{nGrandchild} can be passed in 
#' as a vector of length \code{2}, indicating the number of daughters and number of 
#' sons that the proband and each of her siblings have, when they each have the same 
#' number.
#' @param alleleFreq allele frequencies for each gene of interest (named vector). 
#' @param CP list of cancer penetrance matrices, separated by each gender. 
#' @param genes vector of genes to include in the model. 
#' @param cancers vector of cancers to include in the model. 
#' @param maxMut maximum number of mutations to consider. Defaults to 2. 
#' @param ageMax maximum age to consider. Defaults to 94.
#' @param ageMin minimum age to consider. Defaults to 2. 
#' @param includeGeno boolean flag, indicating whether or not to include genotype 
#' matrix in output. Defaults to FALSE, and was mostly used for troubleshooting. 
#' @param includeGrandparents boolean flag, indicating whether to drop the 
#' grandparents from the final pedigree. Defaults to TRUE. 
#' @param censoring if FALSE, then will assume everyone without any cancers lives
#' to the maximum age. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param genderPro Can be set to "Female" or "Male" to designate the gender of the proband.
#' If left as NULL, the proband's gender will be randomly generated.
#' @param genoMat genotype matrix for the family. This is a matrix where the number of rows is
#' the number of family members and the number of columns is the number of mutations. If
#' left as NULL (the default), the genotypes will be generated.
#' @param CurAge vector of current ages for the family. If left as NULL (the default),
#' the current ages will be generated.
#' @param affTime if TRUE, the output will include the cancer times (which may 
#' or may not be observed due to censoring). Defaults to FALSE
#' @param BiomarkerTesting list of biomarker testing sensitivities and specificities.
#' @param includeBiomarkers boolean flag, indicating whether or not to simulate biomarkers 
#' (Breast and Colorectal currently supported). Defaults to FALSE. 
#' @param maxTries number of runs to attempt for simulating the allele 
#' array and genotype matrix for all family members. Pathogenic variants 
#' on both alleles for a given gene is currently not supported. When this 
#' occurs or an individual has a simulated genotype with more than 
#' maxMut simultaneous mutations, the function's solution is to re-simulate 
#' the alleles/genotypes up to maxTries times. If an admissible allele array 
#' or genotype matrix cannot be simulated after maxTries attempts, an 
#' error will be raised. These scenarios are more likely to occur for large 
#' values of alleleFreq. Defaults to 5 (each). 
#' @details Assumes naming conventions for cancers are consistent between arguments.
