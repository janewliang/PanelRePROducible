#' @param maxTries number of runs to attempt for simulating the allele 
#' array and genotype matrix for all family members. Pathogenic variants 
#' on both alleles for a given gene is currently not supported. When this 
#' occurs or an individual has a simulated genotype with more than 
#' maxMut simultaneous mutations, the function's solution is to re-simulate 
#' the alleles/genotypes up to maxTries times. If an admissible allele array 
#' or genotype matrix cannot be simulated after maxTries attempts, an 
#' error will be raised. These scenarios are more likely to occur for large 
#' values of alleleFreq. Defaults to 5 (each).
